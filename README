    In 2011 Andrij's typeface became a winner of Ukrainian Type Design
    Competition 'Mystetsky Arsenal' in which three main criteria were
    sought for: being zeitgeist, practical, and Ukrainian. Andrij's
    winning entry was crowned Arsenal and made publicly available.

    Arsenal is a semi-grotesque with traditional forms. It is primarily
    designed for body text and intended for various professional
    communication. Its special qualities of letter shapes and subtle
    contrast modulation articulate grace and expressivity. Arsenal's
    somewhat lyrical sentiment abides to the Ukrainian nature of the font.

This package provides the fonts and LaTeX support for them with matching math.

Changes:

   Version 0.2, 2023-09-04.  Added option math=arsenal+kpsans, with
                             math from Arsenal with missing letter
                             from KpSans.  At present the correct
                             spacing works only with LuaTeX.  Now the
                             default for math is iwona, if XeTeX is
                             detected, and arsenal+kpsans, if LuaTeX
                             is detected.

   Version 0.1, 2023-09-03.  The first release version.
