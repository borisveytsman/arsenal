    In 2011 Andrij's typeface became a winner of Ukrainian Type Design
    Competition 'Mystetsky Arsenal' in which three main criteria were
    sought for: being zeitgeist, practical, and Ukrainian. Andrij's
    winning entry was crowned Arsenal and made publicly available.

    Arsenal is a semi-grotesque with traditional forms. It is primarily
    designed for body text and intended for various professional
    communication. Its special qualities of letter shapes and subtle
    contrast modulation articulate grace and expressivity. Arsenal's
    somewhat lyrical sentiment abides to the Ukrainian nature of the font.

This package provides the fonts and LaTeX support for them with matching math.
